##  Keywords for Black Louisiana

**Kinship and Longing** | **in 18th century French and Spanish 

Keywords for Black Louisiana is a *digital humanities project* where we focus on represenidng documents from **18th century French and Spanish colonial Louisiana** and our commitments are three-fold.

1. Bring attention to Black and Black Native life in colonial Louisiana
2. Use **keywords** to link together different actors and stories
3. Re-mix and re-imagine digital tools like [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invE5oVIVOzH6gSe1&inviteToken=12bb5558549f3dfc3b05fa4d19600a07a33372751c12d71913f34dab553be86a&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts)
